# 5Krun

For our final project, we're planning on making an event page for a 5k Run Fundraiser.
The website will be for registration for the runners.
There will be a sign up form, which will save to a database of runners, and will integrate with an organizer's paypal account.
We want to have an interactive design that will show the progress towards the fundraising goal (like a kickstarter).
There also will be pages containing information about the run itself, and links to the foundation we're raising money for.

Possible features:
Creating a team of runners?
Incentives for sign ups? Like raffles
Emails to contestants as reminders

User Workflow: Register personal info, sign liability waver, pay for registration
